Seltra operates on Avalanche C-Chain mainnet and a public testing stack on Avalanche Fuji.

| Environment               | Chain ID | Status                  |
| ------------------------- | -------: | ------------------------ |
| Avalanche C-Chain mainnet |  `43114` | Live — audit in progress |
| Avalanche Fuji            |  `43113` | Live test deployment     |

<Callout type="danger">

Mainnet has passed an internal security review with zero active findings, but **the independent third-party audit has not completed**. Fuji contracts and demo tokens are for testing only — never send production assets to testnet addresses.

</Callout>

### Mainnet stack

Mainnet governance is a 48-hour `TimelockController` that owns Settlement, the Aggregation Router, and the DEX adapters. Four pairs are allowlisted at launch: WAVAX/USDC, WETH.e/WAVAX, BTC.b/WAVAX, and USDC/USDt, routed across the LFJ, Blackhole, and Pharaoh adapters (adapter IDs 1, 2, and 3). Native AVAX is never an order asset — the frontend wraps it into WAVAX before any order is built. See [Mainnet Status](/docs/networks-and-deployments/mainnet-status) for the full picture and [Contract Addresses](/docs/networks-and-deployments/contract-addresses) for verified addresses.

### Fuji stack

The Fuji deployment mirrors the intended governance shape with a Safe guardian and a 48-hour Timelock. The Safe is intentionally 1-of-1 for staging and is not a suitable production signer policy.

The complete address tables and copyable environment configuration are provided in the child pages.
